# Sales-Data-Analysis-by-Categories-and-Trends-using-Python

## Step 1: Set Up the Environment and Load Data
We first import the necessary libraries and load the sales dataset using Pandas. Ensure that your dataset is in the appropriate format (e.g., CSV) with columns such as Category, Sales, and Date.

## Step 2: Explore the Data
We now explore the dataset to gather information such as column names, data types, and the presence of missing values. Additionally, we will display the unique categories.


## Step 3: Data Cleaning
If there are any missing values or inconsistencies, we will handle them. For instance, missing sales figures can be replaced with 0, or you can decide to remove rows with missing values.

## Step 4: Perform Sales Analysis
Here, we calculate the total sales per category and analyze monthly sales trends if the dataset contains a Date column.
